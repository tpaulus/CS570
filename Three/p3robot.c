/*  p3robot.c
      cs570 Program 3
      SDSU

 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Name: p3robot
 * Purpose: This is the program for a single widget-making
   robot. It is intended to be started from the code of p3main.c.
   p3robot.c constitutes an important part of the specification for p3.
   Your code, however, will all be in p3helper.c
   (The p3helper.c stub that I provide in the assignment directory
   should compile and link with this -- and run (though with clearly
   inadequate performance).
 * Input parameters: Note that this program is only intended to be
   exec'd from the code shown in p3main.c
   p3main does the argument validation.
     o argv[0] is a pointer to the name of the program
       (automatically supplied by the runtime system).
     o argv[1] is a string representation of the number 
       of robots needed for this run. This should
       be a positive number <= MAXROBOTS.
     o argv[2] is a string representation of the integer 
       seed to be used for random number generation.
     o argv[3] is a string representation of the positive
       integer specifying the number of widgets to be
       placed on each full row of output.
     o argv[4] is a string representation of the nonnegative
       integer specifying widget quota of each robot.
 * Output parameters: None.
 * Other side effects: p3robot prints its widget output to stdout.
      This is done in coordination with the other robots, per the
      p3 assignment (see ~cs570/program3)
 * Routines called: printf, sprintf, atoi, srandom, sem_open, sem_post,
      fflush, sleep, initStudentStuff, placeWidget, (macro)CHK.
 * References: The p3 assignment file.
