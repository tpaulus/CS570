I wrote the p3helper.c code myself, with some help from the material provided in the course reader.
I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions.

Design:
Every robot tries to create the Semaphore, but because of the "O_EXCL" flag that is set, only the first robot will be
able to open/create the semaphore. The robot that is able to create the semaphore is the first robot, and it will create
the count file. The Semaphore is initialized to 0, which causes the other robots to wait until it is released
(incremented), letting the other robots start. The countfile has the number of widgets that have been placed.

A new line needs to be printed if count % width is equal to one less than the width, and the last widget has been placed
when count == nrRobots * quota - 1. Once the last widget has been placed, the countfile and the semaphore are unlinked
to allow for a clean next run.
