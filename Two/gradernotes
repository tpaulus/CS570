I wrote this code myself, with some help from the material provided on the course website.
I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions.

The user may need to provide 2 EOF signals for Zero-line inputs, but this is a known issue.
An extra prompt may be printed following Detached Commands (commands that end in "&")
depending on the data that is left in the line following the "&".

If executing p2, from within p2, the executable may need to be referenced with its respective
local path, "./p2" rather than "p2", since the working directory for p2 is not on the user's path.

Meta characters are processed in the order that they appear, so if a ">" is parsed immediately
before a pipe character, what follows the pipe will be considered the redirection file, rather
than the start of the next command. If you are indecisive and provide p2 with more than one of
"-n" of "-f", the last option will be used.
